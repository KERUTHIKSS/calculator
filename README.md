## 🛠️ How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Copy the code into a file named `calculator.py`.
3. Open terminal or command prompt and run:

```
1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division
5. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

🧠 Notes
Division by zero is handled gracefully.

Only numeric inputs are expected; no error handling for invalid types is implemented.

The program uses a while True loop for continuous operation.
